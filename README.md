A responsive Agile Poker app.

## Why do we need another Agile Poker app?

I've tried a few, but most are either heavyweight, poorly designed for mobile, or have poor uptime records.  Hence...

## Design Goals

Responsive Poker aims to be:

1. Responsive (obviously).  It should be equally pleasant to use from a desktop (e.g. when working remotely), or from a phone (e.g. when huddling as a team).
2. Highly available.  Currently it's deployed to [poker.jbrunton.com](http://poker.jbrunton.com) using Heroku, and I intend to ensure it remains functional at all times.
3. Simple and intuitive.  It should be as quick and easy as possible to start a room, or to rejoin a recent one.

Suggestions, feedback and feature requests are all welcome.
