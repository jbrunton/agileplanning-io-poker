A responsive Agile Poker app.

### Who needs another Agile Poker app?

I've tried a few, but most are either heavyweight, poorly designed for mobile, or have poor uptime records.

Hence...

### Design Goals

Responsive Poker aims to be:

1. **Responsive** (obviously).  It should be equally pleasant to use from a desktop (e.g. when working remotely), or from a phone (e.g. when huddling as a team).
2. **Highly available**.  Currently it's deployed to [poker.agileplanning.io](http://poker.agileplanning.io) using Heroku, and I intend to ensure it remains functional at all times.  You can see the recent uptime history [here](http://status.agileplanning.io).
3. **Simple and intuitive**.  It should be as quick and easy as possible to start a room, or to rejoin a recent one.  Features won't be added if they detract from this goal.

Suggestions, feedback and pull requests are all welcome.
